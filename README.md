## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full-stack React developer with over 3.5 years of experience building web applications for IRAs at Vanguard. I specialize in React, TypeScript, and AWS, designing performant and scalable front-end experiences while integrating with complex backend systems.

At Vanguard, I developed features like building an accessible search box in close collaboration with UI/UX designers using react-aria, increasing charity donations from $40,000 to $200,000 daily. I also enabled rapid UI development by coaching 2 contractors on component driven UI, delivering the project 2 weeks ahead of schedule.

Iâ€™m passionate about building component libraries, optimizing front-end performance, and designing intuitive user experiences. I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with designers and product teams to align technical execution with business goals.
