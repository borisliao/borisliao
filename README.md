## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer with over 3 years of experience. I specialize in full stack development, designing micro-service infrastructure for individual retirement accounts (IRA) at Vanguard.

During my time at Vanguard, I developed a strong reputation for creating thorough documentation, earning the nickname 'team historian' for my attention to detail. Because of my attention to detail, I spend most of my time building out components libraries in Storybook and architecting the frontend based on upcoming features coming down the pipeline.

You're looking at my personal account, which I have built cool projects such as Music Box. Check it out!
