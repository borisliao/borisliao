## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack React developer at Vanguard for ~4 years now, working at the IRA division, building sites that manage IRA accounts.

I wear multiple hats: one day I'm researching technical feasibility for micro frontends, next day designing a component to display account stock and mutual fund holdings, third day planning the roadmap based on technical findings and building consensus.

I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with designers and product teams to align technical execution with business goals. Novelty is what stimulates my brain; don't ask me to do the same thing day to day, I will automate it so I can focus on real problems!

Love to: 3d print, making automations (recently on ios shortcuts), [city photography](https://borisliao.github.io/hdr?utm_campaign=readme), foodie, nyc, urbanist.

I'm a IoT Maker at heart. Built a multi zone "HVAC" system connecting Awair air monitors to HomeKit, using Eve plugs to control space heaters, hot steam water humidifiers, corsi-box air filter.
