## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Full-Stack React Developer with over 3 years of experience building web applications for IRAs at Vanguard. I specialize in React, TypeScript, and AWS, designing performant and scalable front-end experiences while integrating complex backend systems.

At Vanguard, I developed features like a charity search auto complete that facilitates over $200,000 in daily donations and an IRS required minimum distribution frontend serving 1,300+ clients per day. I also led a team of three to implement a multi-step questionnaire using Storybook and Playwright, achieving 100% test coverage across 17 flows.

Iâ€™m passionate about building component libraries, optimizing front-end performance, and designing intuitive user experiences. I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with designers and product teams to align technical execution with business goals.

You're looking at my personal page, which I have built cool projects such as Music Box. Check it out below!
